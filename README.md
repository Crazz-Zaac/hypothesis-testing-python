# Hypothesis Testing
In this part of my practise the following hypothesis were performed.
- [x] Independent T-test to test the difference between two groups
- [x] Welch's T-test for sampples with unequal variances
- [x] Paired difference T-test for assess the significance of an intervention
- [x] Applying one-way and two-way ANOVA for multiple categorical values

The test were performed on different datasets for the following purpose:
1. Bike sharing data set: To test whether weather situation, temperature affected the numbe of bikes rented.
2. Blood pressure dataset: To test the blood pressure results before and after the intervention are statistically significant or not
